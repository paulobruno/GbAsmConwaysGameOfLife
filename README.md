# Conway's Game of Life - Game Boy Version

This is a personal project I made to exercise the basic GBASM concepts I've been [studying](https://github.com/paulobruno/GbAsmTutorials).
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) is a very known cellular automaton and my friend [Arthur Walraven](https://github.com/ArthurWalraven) made me this nice suggestion.  
The current result is not ideal and I have several improvements on my TODO list.
However, I'm not sure if I'll keep working on this or just jump directly to another project.

*If you are interested in creating your own Game Boy games/projects, take a look at this really [awesome Game Boy development repo](https://github.com/gbdev/awesome-gbdev).*

## Results

WARNING: I must warning you that there is a lot of flickering on the last image, sorry about that :(
I don't know if that's the case, but it may cause discomfort or trigger seizures for people with photosensitive epilepsy.
